# easyShot - welcome!
Hi and welcome on the "easyShot Project",

## What will you find here?
A little project using 2 APIs, Machinescreenshot and Google Drive to instant captures of a website homepage.
On this app, there are 5 selected websites that can be captured by clicking on the button.

The function also permits to automatically upload the screenshot on Google Drive once it has been generated by the first API.
In order to do so, you'll have to be logged on Google by clicking on the corresponding button on the top left of the app.
It is mandatory to do so if you want your screenshot to be upload, otherwise, I will just go on the server, no more. 

If the Machinescreenshot worked fine, you'll get a confirmation message: please note that the usage of the tool is limited with the key.
The key has been deleted of the code in here, if you want to try, please create your account on the corresponding API or ask me for my key.

I hope you'll enjoy!

Any questions or advices regarding this app ? Let me know by sending an email to mattheosf@gmail.com
